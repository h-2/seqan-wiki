Notes and comments about SeqAn taken while the stay at Illumina

  * RazerS3  had a bug in mate pair mode. David fixed it.
  * It is hard to find out how to fill a q-gram index once it is created. (For example for 1) create it 2) set the stepSize 3) assign a stringSet.)  It is irritating to have functions createIndex and indexCreate which both cannot be used to do that.
