= Schedule Wednesday: What do we fix in the next release? =

 1. Resolving tickets
 1. Discus open questions in naming conventions and function names (fill, supremumValue)? Dna/BWT Index_ESA/data_host -> IdentifierRenaming in the Wiki
 1. Documentation System: document include headers, +deprecated/defective/issues tags, Wiki Tutorial/Demos vs. DDDoc Overview/Demos
   * remove Overview pages, transfer them into Wiki
   * complete include tag documentation
 1. What functionality do we need: swap
 1. Release razers2 as the *new* razers
 1. Put microRazerS and SplitRazerS into one folder with its razers.h
 1. What to do with Seeds/Seeds2 in the release?
 1. Include local_swift variation detection tools as *new*?
 1. Adjust module responsibilities

= Schedule Thursday =

= Schedule Friday =

= Tasks =
== Topics to discuss ==

 * Yearly releases or continuously when tests succeed
 * How to handle external contributions
 * Naming convention for abbreviations  Dna or BWT?
 * Naming conventions for helper functions _underdash_joinedCamel_case?
 * Long term aim: Compiling without generated forwards?
 * Motif Finding
 * Seeds/Seeds2

== Renaming/Restructuring tasks ==

 * change fill(obj,size,val) -> resize(obj,size,val) #77
 * add swap #296 and swapValue
 * unify reverse and reverseInPlace #359
 * rename SupremumValue/supremumValue and infimumValue/InfimumValue to [m|M]aximum/[m|M]inimumValue, see #260
 * make internal typedefs in meta-functions local, see #289 Iterator<T>::Iterator defined, Interne typedefs private or with underscore?
 * removing auto-containers, i.e. that `int` is a *container* of `int` of length 1. #360
  * Infixes #288
 * Requirements for a better I/O infrastructure: Files, streams, `FILE*` #361
 * Make I/O subroutines public? #362
 * Holder has to become an auto pointer/smart pointer/shared pointer. #363
 * Iterator conversion concept. What's automatic? What is not? #280 #250
 * Rename demo `iterator` to different name since GCC makes `#include <iterator>` look in the current directory which is bad behaviour and include the iterator binary for demos. (#324)
  * Only a problem if CPATH is set incorrectly.

== Possible tasks for code review days during SeqAn retreat ==

Please suggest issues that we could work on during the code review days of the SeqAn retreat here:

 * Command line parser:
  * OptionType::List
  * Scientific notation #295
 * Journaled Sequence:
  * Cleanup of Journal type.
  * Support the clear and copy space functions so infixes work.
 * Clean alignment algorithms: files, interfaces
 * razers, care about gapped params
 * Add function to batch-write FASTA/FASTQ files, also see attachment:util.h
 * Seed Module
  * extension algorithms in seeds2 module
  * see whether new seed module is affected by #277 
 * Remove multiple entries in documentation, e.g. in seqan:"Tag.Seed Extension".
   * They are there twice because of module seeds2. -- Manuel
 * I think Gotoh has problems, maybe banded broken? I don't remember exactly but there were some issues (with score). -- Manuel
 * ~~Rna alphabet~~
 * ~~more documentation for score matrices~~
 * `#include <seqan/file.h>` nötig für stringausgabe
   * Possible “fix”: rename `file.h` to `io.h` (to make semantics clearer), keep `file.h` for backwards compatibility.
 * Include tests in attachment:test_align_matrix.cpp
 * Fix inserts at beginning of alignments in seqan:Class.FragmentStore, requires some more thought.
 * Minor Tickets: #286 #295 #75 #89 #275 #71 #61 #251 #269 #250 #273 #191 #263 #321 and all other open ones.
 * Tags should be name TagName_ instead of _TagName, see #290.
 * Documentation: Search may return multiple results of same name (e.g. `clear`) without hint which is which.
 * `host` should be an alias to `haystack` for `Finder`s, otherwise certain documentation items (e.g. [http://www.seqan.de/dddoc/html_devel/FUNCTION.begin_Position.html beginPosition]) are incorrect since they only refer to `host`.
   * Similarly, both `host` and `needle` are defined for `Pattern`s but it’s unclear from the documentation how they differ.

== Infrastructure ==

 * Remove spam from Wiki, what about non-editable changes in tickets? (e.g. #77) wrote email to staff
 * Toolbox, building/documentation/marking of apps
 * Documentation system: Add deprecated, defective flag feature.
 * Have ticket components (categories) for every SeqAn module and demos/apps etc.?
