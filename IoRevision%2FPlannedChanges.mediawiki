=== IO-Revision Report Phase 2 (beta) ===

Basic structure of new streaming module, as planned with holtgrew is now in extras/include/stream/

Concept:
*contains stream concept and adaptations for fstream and cstdio, as well as specializations for char array and compressed files. Implementation mostly by holtgrew, partly by h4nn3s (all dddoc'ed and tested)
*could maybe use an adaptation for sequence, as in (old) sequence/sequence_stream.h  [PHASE 3]

Tokenizing:
*contains new tokenizing.h which replaces many frequently used tokenizing functions as well as many helpers for reading [completely dddoc'ed and tested]
*tokenizing functions not transferred to tokenizing.h are deprecated (might be added at a later point in time if really needed)
*contains is.h which right now only contains dddoc for stdcio's is*() calls
*contains lexical_cast.h which offers conversions from string-types to numerical types [ddoced and tested]

Sequence Formats (reading): PRIORITY FOR PHASE 3
*contains basic structure for generic record reader [complete in PHASE 3] and a draft implementation for fasta/fastq
*needs single pass implementations for the following sequence formats: fasta, fastq, embl, genbank, QSeq, raw(?) [PHASE 3]
*needs double pass implementations for the following sequence formats: fasta, fastq [PHASE 3]
*needs something new for detecting file format [PHASE 3]
*create list of things that are still todo

Sequence Formats (writing) PRIORITY FOR PHASE 3
*need something for writing sequence file formats (same formats as above plus CGViz)  [PHASE 3]

The above steps will render the following files deprecated:

#seqan/file/cstream.h
#seqan/file/stream.h
#seqan/file/file_base.h
#seqan/file/file_cstyle.h
#seqan/file/file_filereaderiterator.h
#seqan/file/file_filereader.h
#seqan/file/file_format.h
#seqan/file/stream_algorithms.h
#seqan/file/file_format_raw.h
#seqan/file/file_format_fasta.h
#seqan/file/file_format_embl.h
#seqan/file/file_format_genbank.h
#seqan/file/file_format_cgviz.h
#seqan/file/file_format_mmap.h
#seqan/sequence/sequence_stream.h
#seqan/misc/misc_parsing.h

The following files will be retained:

#seqan/file/chunk_collector.h
#seqan/file/file_page.h
#seqan/file/file_page_raid0.h
#seqan/file/string_external.h
#seqan/file/string_mmap.h
#seqan/file/file_array.h
#seqan/system/file_directory.h
#seqan/system/file_async.h
#seqan/system/file_sync.h



Store-IO: 2nd PRIORITRY
*seqan/store/store_io*
*adapt to RecordReader



Alignment and Alignment Graph formats: Last Prioritry
*TCoffeLib, BlastLib, MummerLib, NewickFormat (all in seqan/graph/graph_align_tcoffee_io.h) and fasta-alignment format (in seqan/graph/graph_align_tcoffee_io.h AND in seqan/file/file_format_fasta_align.h)
*split into individual files
*adapt to new reading and writing structures
