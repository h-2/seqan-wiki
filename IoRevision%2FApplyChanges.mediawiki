==== New Implementations ====

MUST DO:
#write and test reading support for Sequence Formats (Single-Pass)
#write and test reading support for Sequence Formats (Double-Pass for FASTA, FASTQ)
#write and test writing support for Sequence Formats

IF TIME PERMITS:
 4. write and test reading support for Store-IO Formats (Single-Pass)
#write and test writing support for Store-IO Formats (Single-Pass)

WITH EVEN MORE TIME:
 6. write and test reading support for Alignment and Alignment-Graph Formats (Single-Pass)
#write and test writing support for Alignment and Alignment-Graph Formats (Single-Pass)

==== Adapt Apps ====

#Put Compiler-Guards in place
#convert existing apps to new library
#deactivate old IO by default, if all apps could be converted, otherwise allow coexistance
#document changes

==== Clean-Up ====

#Remove code that is no longer required, especially private helper functions etc
#Scan seqan for IOREV-leftovers, especially comments by tagger. Decide what to do about those.
