This page lists and describes functions that large classes of types have to implement and how they are implemented.

== All Types ==

 assign::
   Non-destructive assignment, with optional automatic type conversion.
   `assign(target, source)` is semantically equivalent to `target = source`.
 move::
   Destructive assignment, with optional automatic type conversion.
 set::
   `set(target, source)` is semantically equivalent to `target = source`.
    If possible, set copies content references instead of the content itself.

== Simple Types / Alphabets ==

 convert::
   Explicit type conversion of simple types, i.e. !SimpleType specializations, POD types etc.
 gapValue::
   Returns the gap value of an alphabet.
 infimumValue::
   Returns a value that is `<=` all characters in the alphabet.
 ordValue::
   Returns the numeric identifier of the given alphabet character, within `[infimumValue, supremumValue]`.
 supremumValue::
   Returns a value that is `>=` all characters in the alphabet.

== Containers ==

 append::
   Appending two containers.
 appendValue::
   Appending an entry to a container.
