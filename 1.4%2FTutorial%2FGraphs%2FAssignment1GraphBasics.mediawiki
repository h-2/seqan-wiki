== Task 1 (Graph Basics) ==

=== Task ===
Write a program which creates a directed graph with the following edges:

(1,0), (0,4), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,2), (3,2), (2,3), (7,3), (5,4), (6,5), (5,6), (7,6), (7,7)

Use the function seqan:Function.addEdges instead of adding each edge separately.

Output the graph to the screen.


=== Solution ===

We first have to include the corresponding header file for graphs.
Instead of <tt>seqan/graph_types.h</tt> we can also include <tt>seqan/graph_algorithms.h</tt> as it already includes <tt>seqan/graph_types.h</tt>.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/graph/graph_algo_scc.cpp, fragment=includes)]]

This time we define a seqan:"Spec.Directed Graph" without cargo at the edges.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/graph/graph_algo_scc.cpp, fragment=typedefs)]]

The function seqan:Function.addEdges takes as parameters an array of vertex descriptors and the number of edges.
The array of vertex descriptors is sorted in the way predecessor1, successor1, predecessor2, successor2, ...

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/graph/graph_algo_scc.cpp, fragment=main-graph-construction)]]

The screen output of the graph consists of an adjacency list for the vertices and an edge list:

<pre class="wiki" style="background-color:black;color:lightgray">
Adjacency list:
0 -> 4,
1 -> 0,
2 -> 3,1,
3 -> 2,
4 -> 1,
5 -> 6,4,1,
6 -> 5,2,
7 -> 7,6,3,
Edge list:
Source: 0,Target: 4 (Id: 1)
Source: 1,Target: 0 (Id: 0)
Source: 2,Target: 3 (Id: 7)
Source: 2,Target: 1 (Id: 2)
Source: 3,Target: 2 (Id: 6)
Source: 4,Target: 1 (Id: 3)
Source: 5,Target: 6 (Id: 11)
Source: 5,Target: 4 (Id: 9)
Source: 5,Target: 1 (Id: 4)
Source: 6,Target: 5 (Id: 10)
Source: 6,Target: 2 (Id: 5)
Source: 7,Target: 7 (Id: 13)
Source: 7,Target: 6 (Id: 12)
Source: 7,Target: 3 (Id: 8)
