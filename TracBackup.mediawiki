== Trac Backup ==
[[TracGuideToc]]

Since Trac uses a database backend, some extra care is required to safely create a backup of a [[TracEnvironment| project environment]]. Luckily, [[TracAdmin| trac-admin]] has a command to make backups easier: <tt>hotcopy</tt>.

  ''Note: Trac uses the <tt>hotcopy</tt> nomenclature to match that of [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion], to make it easier to remember when managing both Trac and Subversion servers.''

=== Creating a Backup ===

To create a backup of a live TracEnvironment, simply run:
<pre>

  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv hotcopy /path/to/backupdir

</pre>

[[TracAdmin| trac-admin]] will lock the database while copying.''

The resulting backup directory is safe to handle using standard file-based backup tools like <tt>tar</tt> or <tt>dump</tt>/<tt>restore</tt>.

Please, note, that hotcopy command does not overwrite target directory and when such exists, hotcopy ends with error: <tt>Command failed: [Errno 17] File exists:</tt> This is discussed in [trac:ticket:3198 #3198].

==== Restoring a Backup ====

Backups are simply a copied snapshot of the entire [[TracEnvironment| project environment]] directory, including the SQLite database. 

To restore an environment from a backup, stop the process running Trac (i.e. the Web server or [[TracStandalone| tracd]]), restore the contents of your backup (path/to/backupdir) to your [[TracEnvironment| project environment]] directory and restart the service.

  ''Note: Automatic backup of environments that don't use SQLite as database backend is not supported at this time. As a workaround, we recommend that you stop the server, copy the environment directory, and make a backup of the database using whatever mechanism is provided by the database system.''
