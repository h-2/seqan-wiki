= Task 2: All Strings Of A Given Length =

== Task ==

Write a function {{{printPermutations(len)}}} which, given a parameter {{{len}}}, prints all strings consisting of {{{len}}} lower case letters to {{{std::cout}}}.
Call this function with the parameter 3 in your {{{main(...)}}} function.

== Solution ==

Start off by including the STL IO Streams and the !SeqAn sequence module.

[[Include(source:trunk/core/demos/tutorial/sequence/sequence_all_strings.cpp, fragment=includes)]]

The recursive helper function that calls itself recursively.

[[Include(source:trunk/core/demos/tutorial/sequence/sequence_all_strings.cpp, fragment=print-strings-rec)]]

This function kicks off our recursion.

[[Include(source:trunk/core/demos/tutorial/sequence/sequence_all_strings.cpp, fragment=print-strings)]]

In our main function, we just call {{{printString()}}}.
