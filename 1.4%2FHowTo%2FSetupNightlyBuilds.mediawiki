=== Subversion Repository ===

There is a Subversion repository for the nightly build scripts at http://svn.mi.fu-berlin.de/seqan-nightly/trunk/.

=== Caveats ===

==== 32bit: bzlib and zlib ====

On Debian, you need the packages ''libz-dev'' and ''libbz2-dev''.
If you want to do 32 bit builds, you have to install ''lib32bz2-dev'' and ''lib32z1-dev''.
