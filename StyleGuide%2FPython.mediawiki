== SeqAn Python Style Guide ==

Some very few points:

*Follow [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8].
*Use single-quotes for strings, i.e. <tt>'this is a string'</tt> and double-quotes for docstrings, e.g. <tt>"""This is a docstring."""</tt>.
*Name functions, classes, constants as in SeqAn, variables and member variables are named <tt>lower_case_with_underscores</tt>.
