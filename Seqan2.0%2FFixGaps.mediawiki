== Fixing Gaps in Seqan 2.0 ==

=== Current Status ===

There are various problems with the <tt>Gaps</tt> class and its specializations.

*<tt>begin()</tt> does not work with leading gaps
*Clipping of alignments is broken, e.g. see wiki:HowTo/ClipAlignments
*<tt>SumlistGaps</tt> is more or less just a theoretical experiment, it should go away. In the future, something based on the [http://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/institute-of-theoretical-computer-science/research/sdsl.html SDSL] could be added back if it proves to be faster in important cases.
*The constructors should be changed somewhat such that that interface is coherent.

The basic interface of the <tt>Gaps</tt> class is quite allright, though, the problem lies in thoroughly defining the semantics.

=== Plans ===

*The current interface definitions and semantics should be kept where reasonable, so changes to code using <tt>Gaps</tt> objects are minimal.
*All changes should be driven by the following statement:

    Gaps objects represent ''gapped sequences'' of the whole or selected parts of underlying sequences.
    To the outside, they fulfill the interface of the selected sequence part including gaps.
    All operations use the coordinate system relative to the currently selected part.

=== Actionable Steps ===

Broken down, this comes to the following steps:

*create a new align module in a sandbox and temporarily remove the align module from core (<tt>rm</tt>, '''not''' <tt>svn rm</tt>, do not commit!)
*copy over the <tt>Gaps</tt> class to ''gaps_base.h'', define the class interface there, check that it looks good using <tt>./make.sh ../sandbox/$username/include/seqan/align</tt> in <tt>docs</tt>.
*create the <tt>Gaps</tt> class and two specializations <tt>ArrayGaps</tt> and <tt>AnchorGaps</tt>, copy over the implementations from the old module where possible
*at the same time, create tests and make sure the implementations work correctly
*do the same for <tt>GapsIter</tt>
*move the new <tt>Gaps</tt> and <tt>GapsIter</tt> implementations back to core, adjust any broken code.
