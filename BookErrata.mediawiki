''"SeqAn supports both variants for linear and for non-linear gap costs, and selects it according to the applied scoring scheme."''

This is not true, at the moment, SeqAn only support linear gap costs.

''"That is, we change lines 3 and 4 in Sellers to <tt>v <- i * g</tt> and <tt>v <- (i - 1) * g</tt>." should read "That is, we change lines 3 and 4 in Sellers to <tt>v <- j * g</tt> and <tt>v <- (j - 1) * g</tt>.".''

<tt>j</tt> is meant instead of <tt>i</tt>.

=== Gotoh's Algorithm ===

The initialization is wrong.
