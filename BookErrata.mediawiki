''"SeqAn supports both variants for linear and for non-linear gap costs, and selects it according to the applied scoring scheme."''

This is not true, at the moment, SeqAn only support linear gap costs.

''"That is, we change lines 3 and 4 in Sellers to `v <- i * g` and `v <- (i - 1) * g`." should read "That is, we change lines 3 and 4 in Sellers to `v <- j * g` and `v <- (j - 1) * g`.".''

`j` is meant instead of `i`.

The initialization is wrong.
