[[TOC]]

 Learning Objective ::
  In this tutorial, you will learn about the lexical casting functionality in SeqAn.
  Lexical casting allows you to convert numbers stored as strings to their numeric values.
 Difficulty ::
  Basic
 Duration ::
  15 min
 Prerequisites ::
  Tutorial Basics,
  Tutorial Sequences

== Lexical Casting ==

When reading data from text files all data is usually first stored as strings.
For example, a genomic location is often described as a pair of the chromosome name and the position on the chromosome, e.g. `"chr1"` and `"1000"`.
To really make use of the the `"1000"` we have to cast it to an integer.

For this purpose, SeqAn provides the seqan:Function.lexicalCast and seqan:Function.lexicalCast2 functions.
These functions do not cast a value into a related type but convert a seqan:Shortcut.CharString into its numeric value.

The function is located in the `stream` module so we have to include `seqan/stream.h`.

{{{#!cpp
#include <seqan/stream.h>
}}}

The function seqan:Function.lexicalCast converts a string into the type given in the template argument and returns the value after conversion.
In case of errors, the result is undefined.
This is mainly useful if you know that the value can be converted (e.g. you accepted a sequence of 1-4 digits and want to cast it to `int`).

{{{#!cpp
seqan::CharString valueAsStr = "1000";
int valueAsInt = lexicalCast<int>(valueAsStr);
// => valueAsInt == 1000
}}}

The function seqan:Function.lexicalCast2 has two parameters:
A reference to the numeric destination and the string source.
The result is a `bool` and `true` indicates success.

{{{#!cpp
seqan::CharString valueAsStr = "1000";
bool success = lexicalCast2<int>(valueAsInt, valueAsStr);
// => success == true
// => valueAsInt == 1000
}}}

{{{#!InfoBox
'''Information:''' Strictness of Lexical Casting

A string such as `"123XX"` will be successfully cast into the `int` 123.
The string `-123` can be converted into an `int` using seqan:Function.lexicalCast but it might not be converted correctly into an `unsigned` value.

Lexical casting in SeqAn uses the standard `<sstring>` library.
The exact implementation of casting is library-dependent.
}}}

== A Full Example ==

The example program [source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/extras/demos/tutorial/stream/lexical_cast_example.cpp lexical_cast_example.cpp] demonstrates the usage of both interfaces:

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/extras/demos/tutorial/stream/lexical_cast_example.cpp)]]

This is the program's output:

{{{#!ShellBox
lexicalCast<int>("123")   --> 123
lexicalCast<int>("123XX") --> 123
lexicalCast2<int>("-123") --> (1, -123)
lexicalCast2<double>("-123") --> (1, -123)
}}}

'''Assignment 1:''' Using Lexical Casting
 Type ::
  Application
 Objective ::
  Based on the example above, create a small program that takes one argument.
  This argument is then converted into an `int`, `unsigned`, and `double`.
  The program should display the results of seqan:Function.lexicalCast and seqan:Function.lexicalCast2 as in the example above.
 Hints :: 
  The following shows an example session:
  {{{#!ShellBox
# tutorial_lexical_casting_solution1 10.3
lexicalCast<int>(10.3) ==      10
lexicalCast<unsinged>(10.3) == 10
lexicalCast<double>(10.3) ==   10
lexicalCast2<int>(10.3) ==      (1, 10)
lexicalCast2<unsigned>(10.3) == (1, 10)
lexicalCast2<double>(10.3) ==   (1, 10.3)
# tutorial_lexical_casting_solution1 10
lexicalCast<int>(10) ==      10
lexicalCast<unsinged>(10) == 10
lexicalCast<double>(10) ==   10
lexicalCast2<int>(10) ==      (1, 10)
lexicalCast2<unsigned>(10) == (1, 10)
lexicalCast2<double>(10) ==   (1, 10)
# tutorial_lexical_casting_solution1 TEXT
lexicalCast<int>(TEXT) ==      0
lexicalCast<unsinged>(TEXT) == 0
lexicalCast<double>(TEXT) ==   0
lexicalCast2<int>(TEXT) ==      (0, 0)
lexicalCast2<unsigned>(TEXT) == (0, 0)
lexicalCast2<double>(TEXT) ==   (0, 0)
