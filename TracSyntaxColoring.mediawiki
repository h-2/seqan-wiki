== Syntax Coloring of Source Code ==
Trac supports language-specific syntax highlighting of source code within wiki formatted text in [WikiProcessors#CodeHighlightingSupport wiki processors] blocks and in the [TracBrowser repository browser].

To do this, Trac uses external libraries with support for a great number of programming languages.

Currently Trac supports syntax coloring using one or more of the following packages:

*[http://pygments.pocoo.org/ Pygments], by far the preferred system, as it covers a wide range of programming languages and other structured texts and is actively supported
*[http://www.codento.com/people/mtr/genscript/ GNU Enscript], commonly available on Unix but somewhat unsupported on Windows
*[http://silvercity.sourceforge.net/ SilverCity], legacy system, some versions can be [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracFaq#why-is-my-css-code-not-being-highlighted-even-though-i-have-silvercity-installed problematic]


To activate syntax coloring, simply install either one (or more) of these packages (see [#ExtraSoftware] section below).
If none of these packages is available, Trac will display the data as plain text. 


==== About Pygments ====

Starting with trac 0.11 [http://pygments.org/ pygments] will be the new default highlighter. It's a highlighting library implemented in pure python, very fast, easy to extend and [http://pygments.org/docs/ well documented].

The Pygments default style can specified in the [TracIni#mimeviewer-section mime-viewer] section of trac.ini. The default style can be overridden by setting a Style preference on the [/prefs/pygments preferences page]. 

It's very likely that the list below is outdated because the list of supported pygments lexers is growing weekly. Just have a look at the page of [http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/ supported lexers] on the pygments webpage.
