== Getting Started With SeqAn On Mac OS X Using Xcode ==

[[TOC()]]

This article describes how to get started with SeqAn on Mac OS X using XCode.

We assume that you want to use [http://www.macports.org/ MacPorts] for installing some dependencies (MacPorts is a package management system that easily allows you to install Unix software on OS X).
Of course, if you want to use a different way for installing the dependencies (e.g. using Homebrew) then you are free to do so.

=== Prerequisites ===

First, you have to install the Apple [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action Xcode via Apple Developer] or preferably [http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12 Xcode via the Mac App Store].

After having done so you also need to install the '''Command Line Tools'''. Open Xcode, go to [[MenuTrace(Xcode,Preferences...)]] or simply press [[MenuTrace(⌘\,)]] to open the preferences. Switch to the [[MenuTrace(Downloads)]] tab.
In the shown table you will find the Command Line Tools. Click on  [[MenuTrace(Install)]] to install them.

<pre>#ImportantBox
If you already had Xcode installed and you '''updated to Xcode 4.3''' it is likely that <tt>xcode-select</tt> is not pointing to the new Xcode location.

To make sure you can properly work with Xcode 4.3 please open your <tt>Terminal</tt> and type:
<pre>#ShellBox
~ # xcode-select -print-path
</pre>
The command should output <tt>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer</tt>.
If it doesn't please note down the actual output (for backup purpose) and type in:
<pre>#ShellBox
~ # sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
</pre>
This will configure <tt>xcode-select</tt> properly and make it work with SeqAn.
</pre>

'''Problem with CMake.'''
With the current MacPort version of CMake it is no more possible to open sub projects.
Either open only the root project <tt>seqan.xcodeproj</tt> or install our [attachment:cmake-2.8.9.20120903-g6ef858-dirty-Darwin-i386.dmg patched version of CMake] instead.

Note: The package installs the binary at <tt>/usr/usr/bin/cmake</tt>.
Please add the following line to your <tt>~/.profile</tt> file:
<pre>#ShellBox
export PATH=/usr/usr/bin:$PATH
</pre>

</pre>

After installing the Xcode SDK, please install MacPorts following [http://www.macports.org/install.php these instructions].
To check that the MacPorts install was successful, enter the following on your shell.
If the <tt>port</tt> program is found then you can go on.

<pre>
#ShellBox
~ # port info
</pre>

Next, install Subversion using the <tt>port</tt> command.

<pre>
#ShellBox
~ # sudo port install subversion
</pre>

There is a problem with the current version of CMake.
Please read '''Problem with CMake''' box above and either install our patched version of CMake (see attachments) or the current MacPort  version which has a problem with sub projects:
<pre>
#ShellBox
~ # sudo port install cmake
</pre>

=== Install ===

Now, go to the directory you want to keep your SeqAn install in (e.g. <tt>Development</tt> in your home folder).

<pre>
#ShellBox
~ # cd $HOME/Development
</pre>

Then, use Subversion to retrieve the current SeqAn trunk:

<pre>
#ShellBox
Development # svn co http://svn.seqan.de/seqan/trunk seqan-trunk
</pre>

You can now find the whole tree with the SeqAn library and applications in $HOME/Development/seqan-trunk.

=== A First Build ===

Next, we will use CMake to create an Xcode project for building the applications, demo programs (short: demos), and tests. For this, we create a separate folder <tt>seqan-trunk-build</tt> on the same level as the folder <tt>seqan-trunk</tt>.

<pre>
#ShellBox
# Development # mkdir -p seqan-trunk-build/xcode
</pre>

The resulting directory structure will look as follows.

<pre>
   ~/Development
     ├─ seqan-trunk             source directory
     └┬ seqan-trunk-build
      └─ xcode                  build directory
</pre>

Within the '''build directory''' <tt>xcode</tt>, we call CMake to generate Xcode project files.

<pre>
#ShellBox
Development # cd seqan-trunk-build/xcode
xcode # cmake ../../seqan-trunk -G Xcode
</pre>

This will generate several Xcode project files in <tt>xcode</tt>, namely for the SeqAn core applications, demos, and tests.
The same will happen for the extras and sandbox directories.

Now, open the project for the core applications:

<pre>
#ShellBox
# xcode # open seqan.xcodeproj
</pre>

Xcode starts and will look like this:

[[Image(source:/trunk/core/demos/tutorial/getting_started/xcode/xcode_startup.png, width=500px, align=center)]]

Now we are ready to compile and run our first application.
For this, please choose the target <tt>razers2</tt> in the top left corner of your Xcode application.
When selected click on <tt>Run</tt> just left to where you chose the target.

[[Image(source:/trunk/core/demos/tutorial/getting_started/xcode/razers2_selection.png, width=300px, align=center)]]

Optionally, we could also use "<tt>ALL_BUILD</tt>" instead of "<tt>razers2</tt>".
However, this '''can take a long time and is not really necessary'''.

After having compiled and run <tt>razers2</tt> your Xcode should display <tt>razers2</tt>'s output in the bottom right area.

[[Image(source:/trunk/core/demos/tutorial/getting_started/xcode/razers2_built.png, width=500px, align=center)]]

=== Hello World! ===

Now, let us create a '''sandbox''' for you.
This sandbox will be your local workspace and you might want to have it versionized on your own Subversion repository at a later point.
All of your development will happen in your sandbox.

We go back to the source directory and then use the SeqAn code generator to create a new sandbox.

<pre>
#ShellBox
xcode # cd ../../seqan-trunk
seqan-trunk # ./util/bin/skel.py repository sandbox/my_sandbox
</pre>

Now that you have your own working space, we create a new application <tt>first_app</tt>.

<pre>
#ShellBox
seqan-trunk # ./util/bin/skel.py app first_app sandbox/my_sandbox
</pre>

Details about the code generator are explained in [[HowTo/UseTheCodeGenerator| How To: Use the code generator]].

Now, we go back into the build directory and call CMake again to make it detect the added app.

<pre>
#ShellBox
seqan-trunk # cd ../seqan-trunk-build/xcode
xcode # cmake .
</pre>

<pre>
#InfoBox
'''Information:''' When and where do you have to call CMake?

CMake is a cross-platform tool for creating and updating build files (IDE projects or Makefiles).
When you first create the build files, you can configure things such as the build mode or the type of the project files.

Whenever you add a new application, a demo or a test or whenever you make changes to <tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt> you need to call CMake again.
Since CMake remembers the settings you chose the first time you called CMake in a file named <tt>CMakeCache.txt</tt>, all you have to do is to switch to your <tt>debug</tt> or <tt>release</tt> build directory and call "<tt>cmake .</tt>" in there.

<pre>
#ShellBox
~ # cd $HOME/Development/seqan-trunk-build/xcode
debug # cmake .
</pre>

Do not try to call "<tt>cmake .</tt>" from within the <tt>seqan-trunk</tt> directory '''but only from your build directory'''.
</pre>

The step above creates the starting point for a real-world application, including an argument parser and several other things that are a bit too complicated to fit into the Getting Started tutorial.
Therefore, we will replace the program of the app ''first_app'' with a very simple example program.

Select the file <tt>/Sources/first_app/Source Files/first_app.cpp</tt> in Xcode and open it:

[[Image(source:/trunk/core/demos/tutorial/getting_started/xcode/first_app_old.png, width=500px, align=center)]]

Replace its contents with the following:

<pre>
#cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <seqan/sequence.h>  // CharString, ...
#include <seqan/file.h>      // to stream a CharString into cout

int main(int, char const **)
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    seqan::CharString mySeqanString = "Hello SeqAn!";
    std::cout << mySeqanString << std::endl;
    return 1;
}
</pre>

[[Image(source:/trunk/core/demos/tutorial/getting_started/xcode/first_app_new.png, width=500px, align=center)]]

Afterwards, you can simply compile and run your application by clicking on the <tt>Run</tt> button on the very top left corner in Xcode.

On completion, you should see the following output:

<pre>
#ShellBox
Hello World!
Hello SeqAn!
</pre>

Congratulations, you have successfully created your first application within the SeqAn build system with Xcode!

=== Further Steps ===

As a next step, we suggest the following:

*[[Tutorial| Continue with the Tutorials]]
*Look around in the files in <tt>sandbox/my_sandbox/apps/first_app</tt> or the demos in <tt>core/demos</tt> and <tt>extras/demos</tt>.
*For the tutorial, using the SeqAn build system is great!
