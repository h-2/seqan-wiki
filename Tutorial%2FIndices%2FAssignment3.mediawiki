== Assignment 3 ==

=== Task ===

Write a program that iterates over all nodes of the suffix tree of the string "tobeornottobe" in preorder DFS.
Use seqan:Function.goDown, seqan:Function.goRight and seqan:Function.goUp to iterate instead of seqan:Function.goNext or the operator++.
Output the representatives.

=== Solution ===

First we create an index of the string <tt>tobeornottobe</tt> and an seqan:"Function.TopDownHistory Iterator" that supports seqan:Function.goDown, seqan:Function.goRight and seqan:Function.goUp.

One iteration step of a preorder DFS can be described as follows:
**if possible, go down one node
**if not
****if possible, go to the next sibling
****if not
*****go up until it is possible to go to a next sibling
*****stop the whole iteration after reaching the root node
Thus, the DFS walk can be implemented in the following way:
