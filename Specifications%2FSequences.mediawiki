[[TOC()]]

This page describes the interface of sequences, and ultimately which operations sequences should support.
It is not distinct from the [seqan:Concept.Container Container Concept Specification] but focuses more on the why and how than on the what.

Note that some functions, e.g. `getFront`, `getBack`, `prepend`, are mentioned here that are not part of the sequence/container concept yet.

== Unresolved Issues ==

 * The concept could be called ''Sequence'' instead of ''Container'', this would make sense in my eye (Manuel).
 * Is GetValue<T>::Type == Value<T>::Type in all cases? (Manuel)
 * Do we need an `Id` Metafunction for sequences as there is one for graphs? (Manuel)
 * The semantics of `resizeSpace` are unclear. Functions creating uninitialized memory should not be exposed to the user (Manuel).
 * Do `beginPosition` and `endPosition` return get values only? What about references, const-references? Are coordinates always faster to copy than to take by reference? Do we need `Position`, `GetPosition` and `RefPosition` Metafunctions? I hope not! (Manuel)
 * What about moving and setting whole infixes? A tag to `replace` could be sufficient. (Manuel)
 * `resizeSpace` is very internal? The semantics are not clear to me. (Manuel)
 * dependent objects could also be called "indirection objects" (Manuel)

== Metafunctions, Functions And Their Relations ==

This is not limited to containers.

Generally speaking there are some "very important functions"; for sequences, these are seqan:Function.length, seqan:Function.value and seqan:Function.getValue.
The original idea was that for each such function, there is a Metafunction with the same name but starting with an upper case character that returns the return type of this function.
This makes perfect sense with Functions seqan:Function.length and seqan.Function:getValue.
However, the correspondence for seqan:Function.length is Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Size and Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Value is the value of an element in container.
Function seqan:Function.value returns references (given by Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Reference).

== Types/Metafunctions For Sequences ==

For sequences, the following types (given by their Metafunction names) are relevant:

 seqan:Metafunction.Size::
  The length type for the sequence; type for the number of elements in a container.
  It corresponds but is not equal to the `size_t` type in ANSI C.
  This is an unsigned integer in all cases.
  For one-character-per-position sequences, this cannot be larger than `size_t`, i.e. 32 bit on 32 bit computers.
  However, for compacted strings or externally stored strings, it makes sense to have 64 bit sizes on 32 bit computers, too.
 seqan:Metafunction.Position::
  The type of a position in the container.
  Naïvely, one would expect this to be an unsigned type.
  However, one might want to refer positions before the beginning of infixes or positions before the beginning of a reference sequence for mapped reads.
  Thus, this type can be signed, too.
 seqan:Metafunction.Value::
  The value of a sequence entry.
  For example, `String<char>` has `Value` type `char`.
 seqan:Metafunction.Reference::
  For sequences, it is desirable to behave like arrays, including the subscript `operator[]`.
  This means that `operator[]` has to return a valid lvalue, i.e. a type that can be assigned a value.
  Thus, the return type of this function cannot be `Value` of the string in the `String<char>` case.
  Instead, it has to be `char &`.
  For [seqan:"Spec.Packed String" Packed Strings], however, this cannot simply be `Value<Sequence>::Type &` but must be a seqan:Class.Proxy object.
  Note that compilers will translate references to pointers in the most general case.
  Also, most proxies in SeqAn are implemented in terms of iterators which can be described as "a pointer plus X".
  Thus, for large elements with expensive copy semantics, using Function seqan:Function.value and thus types as returned by Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Reference is faster in the general case.
  This is also the case if you do not want to create a copy because of semantics reasons.
 seqan:Metafunction.GetValue::
  Function seqan:Function.getValue returns value of type seqan:Metafunction.GetValue.
  This type is "a fast, non-mutable version of `Reference`", possibly a copy.
  For example, for `String<char>`, it is `char const &`, whereas it is `Infix<TSequence const>::Type const` for seqan:Class.StringSet Specialization seqan:Spec.ConcatDirect.
 seqan:Metafunction.Iterator ::
  Iterator specialization for iterating the function.
  The first parameter is the container, the second either `Standard` or `Rooted`, where `Rooted` is the default value.
  Rooted iterators have a pointer to their container and standard iterators are as lean as possible, possibly only a single pointer.
  For alloc strings, iterators are simply pointers to their elements, for packed elements, an additional position within one machine word is required.
 seqan:Metafunction.IsContiguous ::
  Returns `true` for containers that store their members in contiguous memory.
  The `begin()` iterator can be converted into a pointer to this memory.
 seqan:Metafunction.LENGTH ::
  Length of fixed-sized containers.

== Default Implementation Of Metafunctions ==

== Generic Functions ==

The following functions are implemented for all built-in types and should be implemented by all classes and specializations thereof.

 seqan:Function.assign — `assign(left, right)`::
  Assign the value `rhv` of the right-hand parameter `left` to the value `lhv` of the left-hand parameter `right`.
  `right` is const and left intact.
  Everything is copied, the old value of the left-hand side is discarded and possibly freed.
  In some languages, this is called ''deep copying.''
 seqan:Function.set — `set(left, right)`::
  Fast, assignment of left-hand parameter to the value of the right-hand parameter.
  Here, only ''shallow copies'' are created, e.g. for Holders and pointers, the value of the Holder/pointer is set but the value itself is not copied.
 seqan:Function.move — `move(left, right)`::
  The value of the left-hand parameter is discarded, the value of the right-hand parameter assigned to the left-hand parameter.
  The right-hand parameter is left in an empty state.
  Also see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x#Rvalue_reference_and_move_semantics Wikipedia on C++0x Move Semantics]
 seqan:Function.swap — `swap(left, right)`::
  The value of both parameters are swapped.
  This is equivalent to the STL `std::swap`.

== Sequence Functions ==

This is the public sequence interface.
Many functions can simply be implemented in terms of other functions, an example for a widely applicable function is `replace`.

=== Query Functions ===

This functions do not change the sequence ''per se''.
Their results can be references, however, to be used to change the sequence.

 seqan:Function.length — `length(seq)` ::
  Returns of the sequence.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Size.
 seqan:Function.capacity — `capacity(seq)` ::
  Returns capacity of the sequence.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Size.
 seqan:Function.value — `value(seq, pos)`::
  Returns reference to a value in a sequence, possibly a proxy, assignment through this is more expensive than seqan:Function.assignValue etc.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Value.
 seqan:Function.getValue — `getValue(seq, pos)`::
  Returns fast, read-only value in a sequence.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.GetValue.
 seqan:Function.front — `front(seq)`::
  Returns reference to first value in a sequence, possibly a proxy, assignment through this is more expensive than seqan:Function.assignValue etc.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Value.
 seqan:Function.getFront — `getFront(seq)`::
  Returns first value fast and read-only.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.GetValue.
 seqan:Function.back — `back(seq, pos)`::
  Returns reference to last value in a sequence, possibly a proxy, assignment through this is more expensive than seqan:Function.assignValue etc.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Value.
 seqan:Function.getBack — `getBack(seq, pos)`::
  Returns last value fast and read-only.
  Type is return type of Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.GetValue.
 seqan:Function.empty — `empty(seq)`::
  Returns `bool` on whether the sequence is empty, in the sense that `(length(seq) == 0) == empty(seq)` but possibly faster.
 seqan:Function.id — `id(seq)`::
  Returns `void const *` identifier.
  Two sequences should have the same id, if they share the same resource, e.g. the same memory buffer.
  Typically, the id of a string is a `void const *` to the end of the string.
 seqan:Function.shareResources — `shareResources(leftSeq, rightSeq)`::
  Returns `bool`, depending on whether the two sequences share resources, i.e. their `id` is equal.

=== Mutating Functions ===

Sequences also provide functions seqan:Function.assign, seqan:Function.set, seqan:Function.move and seqan:Function.swap.

assignValue, moveValue, setValue are possibly faster than calling assign, move, set on the reference.

 seqan:Function.replace — `replace(target, from, to, source)` ::

 seqan:Function.resizeSpace — `resizeSpace(seq, newSuffix)` ::
  Allocate space in a string, possibly leaving memory uninitialized!

=== Iteration / Position Related Functions ===

  Return value is of type seqan:Metafunction.Iterator.
 seqan:Function.iter — `iter(seq, pos)` ::
  Return an iterator into the sequence at the given position.
  Return type is seqan:Metafunction.Iterator of the segment.
  (Rooted iterators are iterators to the segment, non-rooted iterators are iterators into the sequences).

== Dependent Objects ==

Dependent objects have a host, e.g. the underlying string in the case of segments.
We describe this here for the "dependent object" aspect of segments.

=== Metafunctions ===

 seqan:Metafunction.Host ::
