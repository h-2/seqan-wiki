= Creating SeqAn Releases =

 1. Make sure everything is fine:
  * Nightly builds
  * Documentation
  * List of changes and known issues.

 2. Tag the release
  * `https://svn.seqan.de/seqan/trunk@REVISION https://svn.seqan.de/seqan/tags/seqan-VERSION`

 3. Create a new Tutorial version or update the old one on minor releases:
  * wiki:WhitePapers/VersionizingTheWiki

 4. Create a new entry on docs.seqan.de with the current version and update links to it.
  * Create documentation and copy to `/web/docs.seqan.de/htdocs/seqan/VERSION`
  * Make sure to update `/web/docs.seqan.de/htdocs/index.html` and do `chmod u+xR DIR` to allow reading from the web

 6. Wait for automatic package building or kick off manually.

 7. Send an email to the mailing list, e.g. see the [https://lists.fu-berlin.de/pipermail/seqan-dev/2013-April/msg00007.html example for 1.4.0].

 8. Done.
