In order to minimize conflicts, we have assigned the Subversion property ''svn:eol-style'' to all text files in the SeqAn repository.
If you are a SeqAn developer, you should set this property for all new text files (including source files).

Subversion can do this automatically for you.
Add the contents of the file [source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/misc/svn-eol-style.txt misc/svn-eol-style.txt] to your Subversion configuration file.
Usually, these files are located in ''~/.subversion/config'' or ''C:\Documents and Settings\{username}\Application Data\Subversion\config''.

More information can be found in the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html Chapter "Advanced Topics" in the Subversion Manual].
