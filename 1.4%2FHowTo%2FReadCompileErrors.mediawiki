== How To: Read Compiler Errors ==

#'''Q:''' I'm getting weird compiler errors using GCC/LLVM. I have tried quite long to understand it but I simply cannot find the problem.<br>
    '''A:''' Maybe the generated forwards are broken. Try to remove all such headers from your build directory (<tt>find . -name '*generated_forwards.h' | xargs rm</tt> on Linux or Os X. Another way to do this to create a fresh subdirectory of ''/build/'' and re-run CMake.

 2. '''Q:''' When I try to compile under Linux, I get linker error messages like: '''<tt>undefined reference to `aio_suspend'</tt>'''.<br>
    '''A:''' Have you linked your application against the <tt>librt</tt>? Add <tt>-lrt</tt> to the <tt>g++</tt> or <tt>ld</tt> command line.

 3. '''Q:''' When I access files in SeqAn I get a warning: '''WARNING: FilePtr is not 64bit wide'''.<br>
    '''A:''' Large file access is disabled. This is not a problem unless you access 4GB or larger files. To enable large files, you have to make sure to include all SeqAn headers before <tt><fstream></tt> or <tt><iostream></tt>. So reorder:
<pre>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <seqan/index.h>
</pre>
    to:
<pre>
#include <seqan/index.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
</pre>
    Alternatively, you can add <tt>-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</tt> to the <tt>g++</tt> command line.
