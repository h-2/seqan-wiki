 Learning Objective ::
  You will learn how to compute a multiple sequence alignment using SeqAn's alignment data structures and algorithms.
 Difficulty ::
  Basic
 Duration ::
  0:15h
 Prerequisites ::
  [wiki:Tutorial/Basics Basics], [wiki:Tutorial/Sequences Sequences], [wiki:Tutorial/Alphabets Alphabets], [wiki:Tutorial/AlignmentRepresentation Alignment Representation]

Apart from pairwise alignments, also multiple sequence alignments can be computed in SeqAn. The easiest way to do this is by using the function [dox:globalMsaAlignment globalMsaAlignment]. This function computes a heuristic alignment based on a consistency-based progressive alignment strategy as described in [http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/16/i187  Seqan::TCoffee] paper. 

In the following example, we align four amino acid sequences using the [dox:AlignmentGraph AlignmentGraph] data structure and the [dox:Blosum62 Blosum62] scoring matrix with gap extension penalty -11 and gap open penalty -1.
The required header for multiple sequence alignments is {{{seqan/graph_msa.h}}}.
[[Include(source:trunk/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_msa.cpp, fragment=main)]]

First, the sequence type {{{TSequence}}} is defined and a [dox:StringSet StringSet] is declared. The four sequences to be aligned are appended to the StringSet {{{seq}}}.
[[Include(source:trunk/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_msa.cpp, fragment=init)]]

Now we initialize our [dox:AlignmentGraph AlignmentGraph] with the sequences. The graph and the [dox:Blosum62 Blosum62] scoring matrix are handed to the function [dox:globalMsaAlignment globalMsaAlignment] which computes the desired alignment.
