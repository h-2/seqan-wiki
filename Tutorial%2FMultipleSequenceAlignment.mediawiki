 Learning Objective ::
  You will learn how to compute a multiple sequence alignment using SeqAn's alignment data structures and algorithms.

Apart from pairwise alignments, also multiple sequence alignments can be computed in SeqAn. The easiest way to do this is by using the function [dox:globalMsaAlignment globalMsaAlignment]. This function computes a heuristic alignment based on a consistency-based progressive alignment strategy as described in [http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/16/i187 Seqan::TCoffee] paper. 

In the following example, we align four amino acid sequences using the [dox:AlignmentGraph AlignmentGraph] data structure and the [dox:Blosum62 Blosum62] scoring matrix with gap extension penalty -11 and gap open penalty -1.
The required header for multiple sequence alignments is <tt>seqan/graph_msa.h</tt>.
[[Include(source:trunk/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_msa.cpp, fragment=main)]]

First, the sequence type <tt>TSequence</tt> is defined and a [dox:StringSet StringSet] is declared. The four sequences to be aligned are appended to the StringSet <tt>seq</tt>.
[[Include(source:trunk/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_msa.cpp, fragment=init)]]

Now we initialize our [dox:AlignmentGraph AlignmentGraph] with the sequences. The graph and the [dox:Blosum62 Blosum62] scoring matrix are handed to the function [dox:globalMsaAlignment globalMsaAlignment] which computes the desired alignment.
