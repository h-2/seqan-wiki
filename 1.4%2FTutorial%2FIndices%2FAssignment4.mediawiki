== Assignment 4 ==

=== Task ===

Modify the program to efficiently skip nodes with representatives longer than 3.
Move the whole program into a template function whose argument specifies the index type and call this function twice, once for the seqan:Spec.Index_ESA and once for the seqan:Spec.Index_Wotd index.

=== Solution ===

We modify the DFS traversal to skip the descent if we walk into a node whose representative is longer than 3.
We then proceed to the right and up as long as the representative is longer than 3.
