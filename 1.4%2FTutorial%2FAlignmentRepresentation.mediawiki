Before we want to explain SeqAn's alignment algorithms in detail, we will give you an insight in the underlying data structures that are used to actually represent an alignment in SeqAn. 
First, we put our focus on the possible representations of alignments and the ways to access and edit different information of an alignment. The two main objects for this purpose are the seqan:Class.Align and the seqan:"Spec.Alignment Graph" data structure.

=== Align Data Structure ===

The seqan:Class.Align data structure is simply a set of multiple seqan:Class.Gaps data structures. A Gaps data structure is a container storing gap information for a given source sequence. The gap information is put on top of the source sequence (coordinates of the gapped sequence refer to the '''gap space''') without directly applying them to the source (coordinates of the ungapped sequence refer to the '''source space'''). This way operating with gaps sustains very flexible. 

There are two specializations available for the Gaps data structures: seqan:Spec.ArrayGaps and seqan:Spec.AnchorGaps. They differ in the way they implement the gap space.  
<pre>#InfoBox
In general, using seqan:Spec.ArrayGaps is sufficient for most applications. This specialization is also the default one if nothing else is specified. It simply uses an array which stores the counts of gaps and characters in an alternating order. Thus, it is quite efficient to extend existing gaps while it is more expensive to search within the gapped sequence or insert new gaps. 
Alternatively, one should prefer seqan:Spec.AnchorGaps if many conversions between coordinates of the gap and the source space are needed as binary search can be conducted to search for specific positions.
</pre>

Now, let's start by constructing our first alignment. Before we can make use of any of the mentioned data structures, we need to tell the program where to find the definitions. This can be achieved by including the header file <tt>seqan/align.h</tt> which contains the necessary data structures and functions associated with the alignments.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=include)]]

The next steps would be to implement the main function of our program and to define the types that we want to use.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=main)]]

We first define the type of the input sequences (<tt>TSequence</tt>). Then we can define the type of our actual Align  object we want to use. In an Align object, the gapped sequences are arranged in rows. You can use the Metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Row to get the correct type of the used Gaps objects. In the following we use the term <tt>row</tt> to explicitly refer to a gapped sequence as a member of the Align object. We will use the term <tt>gapped sequence</tt> to describe functionalities that is related to the Gaps data structure independent of the Align object.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=typedefs)]]

After defining the types, we can continue to actually construct our own Align object. Therefor we need to resize the alignment object in order to reserve space for the sequences we want to add. In our case, we assume a pairwise alignment, hence we reserve space for 2 sequences. With the function seqan:Function.row, we get access to the gapped sequence at a specific row in the alignment object. This is similar to the seqan:Function.value function used in seqan:"Class.StringSet"s. Now, we can assign the source to the corresponding gapped sequence.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=init)]]

After assigning the sources to the gapped sequences, we need to add some gaps to make it to look like a real alignment. You can use the functions seqan:Function.insertGap and seqan:Function.removeGap to insert and delete one gap or seqan:Function.insertGaps and seqan:Function.removeGaps to insert and delete multiple gaps in a gapped sequence. 

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=manipulation)]]

Congratulations! You have created your first alignment. Note that we used a reference declaration <tt>TRow &</tt> for the variables <tt>row1</tt> and <tt>row2</tt>. Without the reference, we would only modify copies of rows and the changes would not effect our <tt>align</tt> object.

==== Gap Space vs. Source Space ====

In the next steps, we want to dig a little deeper to get a feeling for the gap space and the source space. 
As mentioned above, the gaps are not inserted into the source but put on top of them in a separate space, the gap space. When inserting gaps, the gap space is modified and all coordinates right of the inserted gap are shifted to the right by the size of the gap. At the same time, the coordinates of the source remain unchanged. Using the function seqan:Function.toSourcePosition, we can determine to which position in the source space our current position in the gapped sequence (gap space) maps.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=printingSourcePos)]]

If the position in the gap space is actually a gap, then seqan:Function.toSourcePosition returns the source position of the next character to the right that is not a gap. Vice versa, we can determine where our current source position maps into the gap space using the function seqan:Function.toViewPosition.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=printingViewPos)]]

And here is the output of this short example program so far:

SourceToView1: 0,1,3,4,7,8,
SourceToView2: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,
</pre>

In the first alignment, it seems that the end of the second row is cropped off to match the size of the first one. This effect takes place only in the visualization but is not explicitly applied to the gapped sequence. The second alignment is the one we manually constructed. Here, you can see that the second row is expanded to its full size while it matches the size of the first row. 
However, it is possible to explicitly crop off the ends of a gapped sequence by using the functions seqan:Function.Gaps#setClippedBeginPosition and seqan:Function.Gaps#setClippedEndPosition. These functions shrink the gap space and can be understood as defining an infix of the gapped sequence. After the clipping, the relative view position changes according to the clipping and so does the mapping of the source positions to the gap space. The mapping of the view positions to the source space does not change.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=clipping)]]

Here the output of the clipping procedure.

<pre>#ImportantBox
It is important to understand the nature of the clipping information. It virtually shrinks the gap space not physically. That means the information before/after the begin/end of the clipping still exists and the physical gap space remains unchanged. To the outer world it seems the alignment is cropped off irreparably. But you can expand the alignment again by resetting the clipping information.
</pre>

==== Iterating over Gapped Sequences ====

In the last part of this section, we are going to iterate over a seqan:Class.Gaps object. This can be quite useful if one needs to parse the alignment rows to access position specific information. 
First, we have to define the type of the <tt>Iterator</tt>, which can be easily done by using the metafunction seqan:Metafunction.Iterator. Remember that we iterate over an <tt>TRow</tt> object. Then we have to construct the iterators <tt>it</tt> which points to the begin of <tt>row1</tt> using the seqan:Function.begin function and <tt>itEnd</tt> which points behind the last value of <tt>row1</tt> using the seqan:Function.end function. If you need to refresh the '''Iterator Concept''' you can read the wiki page [[Tutorial/Iterators| Iterators]].
While we iterate over the gapped sequence, we can ask if the current value, at which the iterator <tt>it</tt> points to, is a gap or not by using the function seqan:Function.Gaps#isGap. Use seqan:Function.gapValue to print the correct gap symbol.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment2_align.cpp, fragment=iteratingRowClipped)]]

We will now reset the clipping of <tt>row1</tt> using seqan:Function.Gaps#clearClipping and iterate again over it to see its effect.

Here you can see how resetting the clipping positions brings back our complete row.

=== AlignmentGraph Data Structure ===

Another very useful representation of alignments is given by the seqan:"Spec.Alignment Graph". It is a graph in which each vertex corresponds to a sequence segment, and each edge indicates an ungapped alignment between the connected vertices, or more precisely between the sequences stored in those vertices. Here is an example of such a graph:

[[Image(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_example.png, 500px)]]

In the following we will actually construct this example step by step.
First we include the <tt>iostream</tt> header from the STL and the <tt>align.h</tt> header from SeqAn to include all necessary functions and data structures we want to use. We use the namespace <tt>seqan</tt> and write the <tt>main</tt> function with an empty body.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_representation_alignment_graph.cpp, fragment=main)]]

At the begin of the function we define our types we want to use later on. We define <tt>TSequence</tt> as the type of our input strings. Since we work with a seqan:Spec.Dna alphabet we define <tt>TSequence</tt> as a seqan:Class.String over a Dna alphabet. For the AlignmentGraph we need two StringSets. The <tt>TStringSet</tt> is used to actually store the input sequences and the <tt>TDepStringSet</tt> is internally used by the AlignmentGraph. That is the AlignmentGraph does not copy the sources into its data structure but rather stores a reference to each of the given input strings as it does not modify the input sequences. The seqan:Spec.Dependent StringSet facilitates this behavior. In the end we define the actual AlignmentGraph type.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_representation_alignment_graph.cpp, fragment=typedef)]]

We first create our two input sequences <tt>TTGT</tt> and <tt>TTAGT</tt> append them to the StringSet <tt>strings</tt> using the seqan:Function.appendValue function and pass the initialized <tt>strings</tt> object as a parameter to the constructor of the AlignmentGraph <tt>alignG</tt>.

[[Include(source:tags/seqan-1.4.0/core/demos/tutorial/alignments/alignment_representation_alignment_graph.cpp, fragment=init)]]

Before we construct the alignment we print the unmodified AlignmentGraph. Then we add some alignment information to the graph. In order to add an ungapped alignment segment we have to add an edge connecting two nodes of different input sequences. To do so we can use the function seqan:Function.addEdge and specify the two vertices that should be connected. Since we do not have any vertices yet, we create them on the fly using the function seqan:Function.addVertex. The function addVertex gets as second parameter the id which points to the the correct input sequence within the <tt>strings</tt> object. We can use the function seqan:Function.positionToId to receive the id that corresponds to a certain position within the underlying Dependent StringSet of the AlignmentGraph. We can access the Dependent StringSet using the function seqan:Function.stringSet. The third parameter of addVertex specifies the begin position of the segment within the respective input sequence and the fourth parameter specifies its length. Now, we add an edge between the two vertices of each input sequence which covers the first two positions. In the next step we have to add a gap. We can do this simply by just adding a vertex that covers the inserted string. Finally we have to add the second edge to represent the last ungapped sequence and then we print the constructed alignment.
